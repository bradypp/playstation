Experience lightning fast loading with an ultra-high speed SSD, deeper immersion with support for haptic feedback, adaptive triggers and 3D Audio, and an all-new generation of incredible PlayStationÂ® games.

The PlayStation 5 will have eight Zen 2 cores working at 3.5GHz. This frequency is more than double the Jaguar cores of the PS4 has, and it looks like the CPU has been customized by AMD to match Sony's lofty ambitions. A formidable start to say the least.

Next, we have the graphics card (or GPU). This is a custom RDNA 2 card from AMD. That's the newest graphical architecture going, and its output stands at a hefty 10.3 TeraFLOPs running at 2.23GHz. Even though this isn't quite as high as the next Xbox, it's more than enough to bat a high average with ray tracing. And despite it being a worn-out adage, what you have doesn't always matter - it's what you do with it that's important.

The 825GB NVMe SSD (or 'Solid State Drive') is crucial to this. It allows for much faster data retrieval and loading, cutting down wait-times significantly on the PlayStation 5. It's not a exaggeration to say this changes everything. During a corporate strategy event earlier this year, Sony showed Spider-Man PS4 running on both the current-gen system and the PlayStation 5. While the PS4 takes 8.10 seconds to load, on the PS5 that load time was shortened to just 0.8 seconds.

Solid State Drives are crucial for not just storage, but to use as virtual memory. That makes loading screens a thing of the past.
